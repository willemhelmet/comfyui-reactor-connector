## Save, stop, and get help

**Save Video** writes to `video/reactor/` under the ComfyUI output folder. Examples with sound also save a separate audio file.

Use ComfyUI's cancel control to stop a queued run. Closing a tab does not cancel it. In a live panel, **End Session** stops early and discards the unfinished video.

Select a Reactor node and open native **Info** for inputs, limits, and recovery steps. Use **Fit View** to find all nodes.

## Limits

Live workflows stop at the chosen duration. Fast H3 can create a chosen number of consecutive clips. H3 Reference Turbo uses ordered reference images for the whole clip.

## Open an updated example

Updates do not replace graphs already open in ComfyUI. Save your changes, then open the new example in another tab. Copy any prompts or settings you want to keep.

Only English examples are included. Notes and custom node titles are saved in the graph; changing the interface language does not translate them.

## Sample inputs

Download a sample, then select it in the matching image or video input node.

| File | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [Forest path](./assets/forest-path.png) | Animate an image, explore a scene, or continue a clip. |
| [Forest illustration](./assets/forest-illustration.png) | Animate a landscape or use it as a reference image. |
| [Fictional portrait](./assets/fictional-portrait.png) | Make a portrait speak with LTX. |
| [Forest motion](./assets/forest-motion.mp4) | Edit a five-second clip with SANA or X2. |

### Origin and reuse

The sample images are generated illustrations. The portrait depicts a fictional adult. Project rights in the samples are licensed under [MIT](../LICENSE.md). They are inputs, not examples of Reactor output.

The sample video adds a slow zoom to the forest image: 120 frames at 24 fps, 640 × 360 pixels, standard dynamic range, and no sound. It uses the same license as the images.

### Workflow previews

These images show frames from Reactor output. Your results can differ. Project rights in the previews use the same MIT license.
