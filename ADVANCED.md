# ComfyUI Reactor Connector: Advanced Guide

Use this guide for settings, live controls, model updates, and recovery. For
installation and your first run, see [the setup guide](README.md). Each node's
native **Info** explains its inputs and model-specific limits.

## Keys and access

Open **ComfyUI menu → Extensions → Reactor → Reactor settings**. Saving a key
clears the entry field and stores the value in the private server state directory.
The saved value is never returned to the window or written into a workflow.
Saving a key does not validate it with Reactor.

`REACTOR_API_KEY` in the ComfyUI server process takes precedence over a key
saved in Reactor settings. New sessions use the environment value whenever the
variable is set, including when it is empty. **Clear Saved Key** removes only
the saved file. The settings window reports that the environment key is active
and does not show the value.

Set the variable in the shell that starts ComfyUI, then start ComfyUI from that
same shell.

Linux or macOS:

```sh
export REACTOR_API_KEY="your-reactor-key"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:REACTOR_API_KEY = "your-reactor-key"
```

Restart ComfyUI after you change the variable. A session that has already
started keeps the key it started with. Unset `REACTOR_API_KEY` and restart to
use a saved key again. An empty value still overrides the saved key, and the
run fails until you remove the variable or assign a key. The key cannot contain
spaces.

Private settings and live controls require a local, single-user connection.
Open the ComfyUI window on the computer running its server and connect directly
to the local address. Remote connections and reverse proxies cannot change
credentials. Set the server environment key for those setups.

The default state locations are:

| Platform | Directory                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/ReactorComfyUI`    |
| Linux    | `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/reactor-comfy` |
| Windows  | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ReactorComfyUI`                   |

`REACTOR_COMFY_STATE_DIRECTORY` can select another absolute private path. It must
be outside the package, ComfyUI source, and configured input, output, temporary,
and user folders. Files use owner-only permissions where supported. They are
not encrypted; other code running as the same operating-system user can read them.

## Runtime gotchas

### Comfy Cloud

Comfy Cloud does not install this GitHub pack. Run it in ComfyUI Desktop, a
manual install, or another self-hosted ComfyUI, and post workflows to that
server's `/prompt` route.

### CPU-only PyTorch

When the ComfyUI environment's PyTorch build has no CUDA device, start ComfyUI
with `--cpu`. Without that flag, saving or previewing video can raise a CUDA
device assert after Reactor has produced frames.

### Save Video in API prompts

`/prompt` accepts Save Video format and codec as flat keys: `format`,
`format.codec`, and, when you set a codec outside the format choice, `codec`.
A nested `format` object fails validation because ComfyUI expects the selected
choice as a string and child controls as dotted keys. The shipped
[Helios API workflow](workflows/api/helios-01-text-to-video.json) uses the flat
shape. `mise run comfy:workflows:build` rewrites that file from the canvas graph.

## Session limits

**maximum video duration** limits the requested output length. **maximum session duration** limits the whole Reactor session and must allow additional time for
setup. **Advanced limits** controls connection, first-frame, disconnect, and queue
timeouts, plus media size limits. One MiB is 1,048,576 bytes.

The connector runs one session at a time. Other runs wait; the default queue
wait limit is 120 seconds. You can cancel while waiting, before connection.
A rejected command or uncertain connection is not retried automatically.

New runs use saved settings. A running session keeps its original key and limits.
Changing the effective key or execution limits prevents reuse of an earlier
ComfyUI result on the next run.
Model-update settings do not affect reuse of saved results. Change **run number** to
request a new run with otherwise unchanged inputs. A seed does not guarantee
identical results after a provider update.

If another window saves settings first, reload before making your changes again.
Invalid settings leave the previous file intact. Saving settings does not cancel
active work or remove saved media.

## Credit rates

Open **ComfyUI menu → Extensions → Reactor → Reactor models** for public rates.
Expand **Calculate credits for session time** to multiply a rate by a chosen
session time. Setup and recording preparation can add time beyond the video
length. The calculation is not a quote or spending limit; refer to Reactor for
actual charges. A missing or unconfirmed rate produces no calculation.

Refresh the model list for current prices. **Model sources and automatic checks**
shows when rates were checked.

## Model updates

Open **ComfyUI menu → Extensions → Reactor → Reactor models** to search the
included list or your last saved list. Opening the dialog reads local information.
Each entry shows its last checked rate, any available guide, and node support.

Models supported by the installed nodes appear before the first refresh. Refresh the list to load public
prices and metadata. Saved metadata stays in Reactor's private application-data folder on the ComfyUI server.

**Refresh Models** reads Reactor's public prices and model guides. Entries come from
published prices or guides; your account determines which models you can run.

| Status                                              | Meaning                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Nodes available                                     | This connector includes nodes for the model.                                                                       |
| No connector node available                         | The model cannot run through this connector.                                                                       |
| This rate was not found in the latest source check. | The earlier entry was retained. Its old rate is not a current quote. Absence does not prove the model was removed. |

Refreshing does not add nodes, change their connections, or change active
workflows. New models need support in the connector before they can run.

A failed refresh leaves the current list intact. **Restore Previous List** restores
the list saved before the latest refresh. Both actions keep your search text.
Only the local ComfyUI user can change the list.

### Automatic checks

Under **Reactor settings → Model updates**, enable checks and choose an interval
in hours. New installations check at startup and every 24 hours while ComfyUI
runs. Existing saved preferences are preserved. Changes take effect within one
minute; an active check can take up to 25 seconds to finish.

Checks use the same public sources as refresh. They report changes without
replacing the saved list. Expand **Model sources and automatic checks** in the
model dialog, then select **Refresh Models** to save the checked list. Reopen the
dialog to see a check that finished after you opened it. Failed checks keep the
list and retry at the configured interval. Closing ComfyUI stops checking.

## Live controls

Choose a recording duration before running. The live panel belongs to the
ComfyUI window that started the workflow. Leaving it open does not extend the
session. Find the examples in the [workflow index](workflows/README.md).

Noninteractive generation can run through the ComfyUI API without a browser.
Interactive and webcam modes require the browser that submitted the workflow; a
bare API client cannot supply their controls. A browser is not required for the
local prompt-sequence and storyboard builders.

| Task                                     | Use                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Change the scene while recording         | Helios, LongLive, or Visko live-prompt workflow         |
| Change an edit while a source clip plays | SANA or X2 live-prompt workflow                         |
| Drag an edited subject                   | X2 live-prompt or webcam workflow                       |
| Edit a camera feed                       | SANA or X2 webcam workflow                              |
| Move through an image                    | LingBot or LingBot World 2 workflow with scene controls |
| Continue several clips                   | Fast H3 continued-scene workflow                        |

Ordinary Helios, LongLive, Visko, SANA, and X2 generation nodes have a **live controls** switch, off by default. LongLive storyboards keep their prepared shots.

### Change prompts or use a webcam

1. Set the prompt and video length, then select **Run**.
2. For a webcam node, select **Enable Camera** and allow camera access. Check the
   preview. To switch cameras, choose one and select **Switch Camera**.
3. Select **Start Session** within 60 seconds.
4. When controls are ready, edit the prompt and select **Apply Prompt**.
5. Let the chosen recording duration finish to save the result.

Changes affect later frames and leave the saved workflow prompt unchanged.
LongLive uses a soft shot transition; Visko keeps **use prompt unchanged** as set
on the node. Starting and reference images stay fixed throughout the session.

Webcams need localhost or HTTPS, camera permission, and local single-user access.
The panel requests video only. Frames go to the local host before starting and
to Reactor only during the session. There is no microphone input or separate
camera recording. Camera access stops when the panel closes or recording ends.

Input uses up to 640 × 480 pixels and ten new frames per second. The latest frame
is repeated on a 24 fps input. Saved output uses the model's resolution. The
separate preview uses up to 640 × 360 pixels at ten frames per second without sound.

### Change Visko audio

Turn **generate audio** on before running. During recording, edit **audio prompt**
and select **Apply Audio Prompt**. Leave it blank to let the picture guide sound.
Changes affect later sound; play the saved video to hear it. Resolution and sound
on/off stay fixed during the session. Changing them requires a new run.

### Drag in X2

Drag on the output to steer the subject; release to stop. For keyboard control,
focus the picture, use arrow keys to position the pointer, and hold Space to
activate it. Escape or losing focus releases the pointer. A circle marks your
chosen point, measured from the picture's left and top edges.

**Pointer held** and **Pointer released** confirm that input was accepted. Watch
later frames to judge its effect. X2 processes groups of frames, so changes can lag.

### Move in LingBot

Upload an image and run a workflow with scene controls. Click the picture: W and S move
forward and back, A and D move sideways, and arrow keys turn. Click a direction
button briefly or hold it to keep moving. Escape releases movement. World 2 can
combine forward and sideways movement.

Rapid changes can skip earlier movements; old movement is released before the
latest direction is applied. Edit **scene prompt** and select **Apply Prompt**
to change later frames. Editing the prompt releases held movement. The starting
image and saved workflow prompt stay unchanged. Saved video cannot reopen a world,
and clicking its playback does not move the camera.

### Save or stop

Let recording finish. **Save Video** writes the result under ComfyUI's
output folder. **End Session** stops early and discards the unfinished video.
ComfyUI cancellation also ends the run. Closing a workflow tab does not cancel it.

The session ends if the live panel stops responding for five seconds. Webcam input
also ends after three seconds without a new frame. Cleanup can take longer; wait for
the end message. If termination is unconfirmed, wait for the session limit before
another run. The connector does not reconnect automatically.

### Continue a scene

[Fast H3 continued scenes](web/docs/ReactorIncFastContinue.md) use the previous
clip's final frame to build the next clip. Choose a clip count and later prompts.
The result is one video with sound. Recording ends after the chosen number of
clips. Set the video duration limit high enough for their combined length.

## Recording details

The **recording details** output is a JSON string describing the saved media.
Its serialized socket name remains `metadata`. Connect it to a text display or
another node to inspect it; saving the video does not save this text separately.

| Field                              | Meaning                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `schema_version`                   | Report format version, currently `1`.                              |
| `run_id`                           | Random local execution ID; grants no session access.               |
| `node_id`, `model_name`            | Node ID and model connection name used for the run.                |
| `connector_version`, `sdk_version` | Connector and installed Reactor SDK versions.                      |
| `frames`                           | Number of encoded video frames.                                    |
| `width`, `height`                  | Saved dimensions in pixels.                                        |
| `file_bytes`                       | Completed MP4 size, including embedded audio.                      |
| `has_audio`                        | Whether the MP4 has an audio track; the track may contain silence. |
| `requested_duration_seconds`       | Requested length; clip length times count for continued scenes.    |
| `duration_seconds`                 | Duration reported by the MP4 video stream, or `null` if absent.    |
| `timestamp_mode`                   | Frame-timing method described below.                               |

`sender` preserves received timestamps. `fallback_fps` uses the adapter's frame
rate when the stream supplies no initial timestamp. `recording_pts` uses the
downloaded Reactor recording's timestamps to align video and sound.

A `live` object can include acknowledged action counts, preview frames, and
control timing. Acknowledgment does not prove the requested change is visible.
Saved length can differ from the request when the model chooses another accepted
length or ends early. File details do not assess visual quality or billed time.

Reports omit prompts, images, keys, tokens, remote session IDs, and absolute paths.
ComfyUI may reuse a cached report and its `run_id`; pressing **Run** does not prove
a new session started. Do not rerun solely to update a report.

## Recording overhead

### Fast H3

After the selected clip finishes, the connector builds and starts one additional
continuation. This advances the recording service so it can finish the selected
clip's media fragments. The continuation uses credits but is omitted from the
saved output. Its requested length is the deployment's longest clip, currently
14.375 seconds. The session ends as soon as the selected recording is ready,
even if that continuation has not finished. The host session cap still applies.

### LTX

LTX may generate up to 20 extra seconds while Reactor prepares the recording.
These seconds can use credits and are not saved. The session time limit applies
to the whole run.

## Recovery

Read the error and the node's native **Info** before trying again. Pausing a video preview does not stop its session.

| Problem                      | Next step                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Missing or rejected key      | Check Reactor settings and any server environment key, which takes precedence.                   |
| Rejected input               | Check the node's prompt, image, video, duration, and size limits.                                |
| Another session is active    | Let it finish. Wait for confirmed cleanup before another run.                                    |
| Video did not arrive in time | Check [Reactor status](https://status.reactor.inc/) and the session limit before retrying.       |
| Recording cannot be saved    | Check disk space and media limits. Some models also need Reactor's recording service.            |
| Session end is unconfirmed   | Wait for the configured session limit; do not repeatedly queue or clear wait records.            |
| Model refresh fails          | Keep the current list and retry the public-source refresh later.                                 |
| A live panel expires         | Let cleanup finish before running again.                                                         |
| Camera is unavailable        | Allow access, select **Enable Camera**, and release the camera in another application if needed. |

### Recover after a restart

If ComfyUI closes before session termination is confirmed, a private record
keeps the required wait time. New runs show the remaining seconds. Restarting,
changing keys, or lowering limits does not bypass it. Processes sharing the
same state directory cannot run Reactor sessions at the same time.

Do not delete `session.json` or `session.lock` to skip a wait. If a record is
damaged, confirm that no session remains active in Reactor before repairing it.

### Private diagnostics

`last-failure.json` in the state directory records the latest failed operation,
error code, and a short message. Recognizable keys, tokens, the configured
credential, and URLs are removed. The file is replaced by the next failure.
It is not served to the window or included in workflow results, but it can contain
private prompt or model details. Review any excerpt before sharing it.

## Update or remove

Finish or cancel active work, wait for sessions to end, then stop ComfyUI
before changing the connector.

To update a source checkout, replace the whole `custom_nodes/reactor-inc` folder with the new source, install
its runtime requirements using ComfyUI's Python, and restart. Refresh the
ComfyUI window.

Keep only one installed copy in `custom_nodes` to avoid duplicate nodes and menus.

Open an updated example in a new workflow tab. Existing tabs and saved graphs
keep their own notes, prompts, and layout. Copy settings you want to reuse before
closing the old graph.

To remove the connector, move its folder outside `custom_nodes` and restart.
Keep shared Python dependencies that other packs may use. Removing or updating
the package preserves private state, media, and saved workflows. To remove state
too, confirm all sessions ended and delete only its [state directory](#keys-and-access).
Deleting a saved key does not revoke it in Reactor.

## Language

This release includes English text and guides. Installed translations use the
language selected in ComfyUI. Custom panel labels follow language changes;
English remains the fallback when a message or guide is missing.

Saved workflow notes and custom titles keep the language used when the workflow
was built. Example prompts and speech scripts stay in English. Changing ComfyUI's
language does not rewrite your graph or translate model inputs. Node search
aliases, categories, placeholders, and errors from queued execution currently
use English. An error already returned by the server keeps its original text.
Native dropdowns can show saved values such as `idle`, `soft`, and `cut` even
when the locale file supplies translated option labels. The node guides explain
these values.
Connector HTTP routes select translations from `Accept-Language`; queued node
execution does not inherit that request language.

To translate workflow notes and titles:

1. Choose a locale tag, such as `fr`. Create `locales/<tag>/workflows.json` using
   `locales/en/workflows.json` as the reference. Translate the message values;
   preserve JSON keys and placeholders such as `{title}`, `{first}`, and `{second}`.
   Partial translations use English for missing messages.
2. Review the translation before building. Only English resources are supplied
   with this checkout; the command below requires your added locale file.
3. Set `workflow_language` to your locale tag, then generate a separate folder:

    ```sh
    workflow_language=fr
    mise run comfy:workflows:build -- --language "$workflow_language" --output-directory ".artifacts/workflows/$workflow_language"
    ```

The build checks the supplied translation against the English message keys and
placeholders. It translates workflow labels and notes, not prompts or speech
scripts. The output index links to this checkout's shared guides and sample
files. Keep it with that checkout; it is not a standalone translated package.

## Development commands

Run `mise run repo:setup` to install the pinned tools and dependencies and enable local
Git hooks. Bun manages frontend dependencies; uv manages Python dependencies.
Development tools use the repository environment, separate from ComfyUI.

Development scripts run as modules of the checkout package through mise.
Quality tools run from the repository root. ComfyUI starts media workers through
the root launcher in isolated Python processes; those workers use only the media
modules and static configuration.

Browser TypeScript in `web/scripts/` and CSS in `web/styles/` build to
`web/extension.js` and `web/extension.css`. ComfyUI serves node guides from
`web/docs/`. Frontend checks use the official ComfyUI frontend types.

Python checks read types from your actual ComfyUI installation. Set its source
directory in your terminal before running development commands:

```sh
export COMFYUI_PATH="/path/to/ComfyUI"
```

That directory must contain `main.py` and `comfy_api`. Checks use its `.venv`
Python by default. If ComfyUI uses another environment or Windows portable,
also set `COMFYUI_PYTHON` to that installation's Python executable:

```sh
export COMFYUI_PYTHON="/path/to/ComfyUI/python"
```

Replace these example paths with your installation's paths. The variables apply
to commands run from that terminal; they are not stored in the repository.

Setup downloads the pinned Semgrep rules into ignored local storage and verifies
their content hashes. To restore those files, run `mise run repo:security:rules`.
The downloaded rules retain their upstream license notices and are not included
in the connector package.

Tasks use two groups: `repo` for development tools and checks, and `comfy` for
connector builds, workflows, models, and Registry releases. Run `mise tasks` to
list every task.

| Command                          | Purpose                                                                                           |

| `mise run repo:deps:export`      | Generate runtime requirements from project metadata.                                              |
| `mise run repo:format`           | Format source files.                                                                              |

| `mise run repo:type:python`      | Check Python types against the selected ComfyUI installation.                                     |
| `mise run repo:audit:python`     | Check Python dependencies against advisory services.                                              |
| `mise run repo:audit:frontend`   | Check frontend dependencies against advisory services.                                            |
| `mise run repo:security:rules`   | Download and verify the pinned Semgrep rule packs.                                                |
| `mise run comfy:frontend:build`  | Build the shipped JavaScript and CSS.                                                             |
| `mise run comfy:workflows:build` | Build the example graphs and workflow index.                                                      |
| `mise run comfy:models:check`    | Read public prices and guides without saving them.                                                |
| `mise run comfy:models:validate` | Check node registrations and translations.                                                        |
| `mise run comfy:release:package` | Run checks, then build the official node.zip with comfy-cli and inspect it locally.               |
| `mise run comfy:release:publish` | Check and package the connector, then publish a Registry version with comfy-cli.                  |

Pre-commit checks scan staged changes for secrets and reject staged private
settings files. They also check source files, frontend types, and generated output
in the working directory. Pre-push runs `mise run repo:check` against the working
directory. Hooks do not stash or rewrite your work.

Builds write generated assets; checks and hooks do not install dependencies or
start generation. Dependency audits need network access and do not apply fixes.

The workflow builder writes flat JSON files under `workflows/`, the
directory ComfyUI's native Templates browser reads. The same files appear in
native **Browse Templates → reactor-inc** from a checkout and from an installed
package. Rebuild examples before packaging.

Python checks use actual ComfyUI and dependency types. Where an upstream API lacks
complete annotations, the code defines only the interface it consumes. Check
changed host calls manually in the installed ComfyUI as well.

## Official packaging and publishing

Use [Comfy's official CLI](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-cli) to create and
publish the Registry package. The commands below use comfy-cli 1.20.0.

1. Create a publisher and publishing API key in
   [Comfy Registry](https://docs.comfy.org/registry/publishing). The publishing
   key is separate from the Reactor key used to generate videos.
2. Set `[tool.comfy].PublisherId` to that publisher's ID in `pyproject.toml`.
   Check `[project.urls].Repository` and choose an unused semantic version in
   `[project].version`. Published versions cannot be overwritten.
3. Build the distribution files:

    ```sh
    mise run repo:deps:export
    mise run comfy:workflows:build
    mise run comfy:frontend:build
    ```

4. Commit the reviewed source and built assets. The official packer selects
   Git-tracked paths and reads their current working-tree content. New untracked
   files are omitted. `.comfyignore` excludes development files.
5. Run the release task:

    ```sh
    mise run comfy:release:package
    ```

    This runs the project checks, including network-backed dependency, security,
    and link checks. It then calls `comfy node pack`, lists the contents of
    `node.zip`, and scans the archive for secrets.

6. Publish when ready. This repeats the package checks before publishing:

    ```sh
    mise run comfy:release:publish
    ```

    Enter the Registry publishing key at the hidden prompt. No `.env` file is
    required. This CLI does not read `REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN` automatically.

    Choose the publisher ID yourself when creating the account. Comfy requires
    this public ID in the committed `pyproject.toml`; it cannot be renamed after
    account creation. The API key authorizes publishing and stays private.

7. Install the published version through ComfyUI Manager and check node loading,
   menus, help, and templates in that installation.

Publishing creates a new archive from the checkout. Keep the source, built
assets, tracked paths, metadata, `.comfyignore`, and CLI version unchanged after
inspection. The publish command does not upload the previously inspected ZIP.

For later releases, update the version and repeat this procedure. Keep publishing
credentials outside the repository and browser assets.
